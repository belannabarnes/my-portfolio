      <p>My name is B'Elanna Barnes, but my friends like to call me Lanna. I'm from North Little Rock, Arkansas, and am a rising junior at Washington University in St. Louis. I am a computer science major and human-computer interaction minor.</p>
      <p>This is me!</p>

      <p>My dad is from St. Louis and my mom is from New Orleans. As far as pets, I have a cat named Nahla.</p>
      <p>This is Nahla. She thinks she rules the house. If we're being honest, she kind of does.</p>
